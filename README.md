# Techset - find electronics at prices you deserve
In the last few years buying tecnology has become increasingly and needlessly expensive, and has caused many to move over into the used market. Only issue is, the used market isn't much better.
Sites like eBay and Vinted, although useful for many of our mini-purchases, have become massive fronts for resellers, scalpers, and joblot listings. This is the exact reason why I created TechSet, to enable the technology community to find the electronics and games they want, at a price thats genuinely fair to them.
My decision to make the site's source code open source stems largely from the fact that this has begun as a school project, and as such, I require access to it from wherever I may need.
